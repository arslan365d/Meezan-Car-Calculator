# Meezan-Car-Calculator

ðŸš—ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m excited to share a project that Iâ€™ve been working on â€” a Car Payment Plan Calculator, inspired by Meezan Bankâ€™s calculator. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to easily calculate and compare payment plans across three available cards, helping make car financing decisions clearer and more efficient. Itâ€™s a great resource for anyone looking to understand their options better before making a commitment.

Feel free to check it out and explore its features at this link ðŸ‘‡
